# Cryptocurrency Liquidity Prediction for Market Stability

# Problem Statement

Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile,and liquidity plays acrucial role in market stability.Lliquidity refers to the ease with which assets can be bought or sold without significantly impacting the price.Alack of liquidity can lead to increased price fluctuations and market instability.

In this project,you are required to build a machine learning model to predict cryptocurrency liquidity levels based on various market factors such as trading volume,transaction patterns,exchange listings,and social media activity.The objective is to detect liquidity crises early to help traders and exchange platforms manage risks effectively.

Your final model should provide insights into market stability by forecasting liquidity variations, allowing traders and financial institutions to make informed decisions.

# Dataset Information

You will use α dataset that includes historical cryptocurrncy price and trading volume data from below link. The dataset consists of records from 2016 and 2017. Dataset : - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10BRgPip2Zj_56is3DilJCowjfyT6E9AM

# Data Preprocessing Required:

· Handle missing values and ensure data consistency.   
· Normalize and scale numerical features.   
· Engineer new features related to market liquidity trends.

# Project Development Steps

1. Data Collection: Gather historical cryptocurrency price,volume, and liquidity-related data.

2.Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values,clean data, and normalize numerical features.   
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze data patterns, trends, and correlations.   
4.Feature Engineering: Create relevantliquidity-related features such as moving averages,volatility, and liquidity ratios.   
5. ModelSelection: Choose appropriate machine learning models such as time-series forecasting, regression, or deep learning approaches.   
6. Model Training: Train the selected model using the processed dataset.   
7. Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and $\mathsf { R } ^ { 2 }$ score.

8.Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters for better accuracy.   
9. Model Testing & Validation: Test the model on unseen data and analyze predictions.   
10. Local Deployment: Deploy the trained model locally using Flask or Streamlit for testing.
