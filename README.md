- Interactive web dashboard with Streamlit

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Logistic Regression Assignment
1. Open `Logistic_Regression.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells to see complete implementation
3. Each question is in a separate cell with working code

### For Cryptocurrency Project
1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Train Models**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Launch Web App**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
