        "### Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Filters (Kernels):**\n",
        "- Filters are small matrices (typically 3x3, 5x5, or 7x7) that contain learnable parameters\n",
        "- They act as feature detectors that scan across the input image\n",
        "- Each filter is designed to detect specific patterns or features (edges, textures, shapes, etc.)\n",
        "- During training, the network learns optimal filter weights through backpropagation\n",
        "- Different filters specialize in detecting different features (horizontal edges, vertical edges, corners, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Feature Maps:**\n",
        "- Feature maps are the output produced when filters are convolved with the input\n",
        "- Each filter produces one feature map, showing where that particular feature is detected\n",
        "- Feature maps highlight regions in the input that contain the features the filter is looking for\n",
        "- Multiple filters create multiple feature maps, each capturing different aspects of the input\n",
        "- Feature maps become increasingly abstract as we go deeper into the network\n",

        "- Filters are the \"tools\" that extract features\n",
        "- Feature maps are the \"results\" showing where those features are found\n",

        "- Padding refers to adding extra pixels (usually zeros) around the input image\n",
        "- **Valid Padding (No Padding):** No padding is added, resulting in smaller output dimensions\n",
